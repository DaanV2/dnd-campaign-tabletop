# Separation

**♏︎, Scorpio**

The process is a method that converts a mixture or a [solution](Solution.md) of
chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures, a scientific
process of separating two or more substance in order to obtain purity. At least
one product mixture from the separation is enriched in one or more of the source
mixture's constituents. In some cases, a separation may fully divide the mixture
into pure constituents. Separations exploit differences in chemical properties
or physical properties between the constituents of a mixture.

The purpose of separation may be:

**analytical**: to identify the size of each fraction of a mixture is
attributable to each component without attempting to harvest the fractions.

**preparative**: to "prepare" fractions for input into processes that benefit
when components are separated.

Using magic the alchemist can separate a mixture of substances into its pure
form. Though requires knowledge of the substance, and the properties of the pure
form. As well as the necessary tools, equipment, rites and arcane circles to
perform the separation.
