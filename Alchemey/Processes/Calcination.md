# Calcination

**♈︎, Aries**

The heating of solids to a high temperature for the purpose of removing volatile
substances, oxidizing a portion of mass, or rendering them friable. Calcination,
therefore, is sometimes considered a process of purification.

Alchemists distinguished three kinds of calcination, **actual**, **potential**
and **philosophical**.

**Actual calcination** is brought about by actual fire, from wood, coals, or
other fuel, raised to a certain temperature.

**Potential calcination** is brought about by potential fire, such as corrosive
chemicals; for example, gold was calcined in a reverberatory furnace with
mercury and salammoniac; silver with common salt and alkali salt; copper with
salt and sulfur; iron with sal ammoniac and vinegar; tin with antimony; lead
with sulfur; and mercury with nitric acid.

There was also **philosophical calcination**, which was said to occur when
horns, hooves, etc., were hung over boiling water, or other liquor, until they
had lost their mucilage, and were easily reducible into powder.
