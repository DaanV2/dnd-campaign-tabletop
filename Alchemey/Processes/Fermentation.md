# Fermentation

**♑︎, Capricorn**

The process that produces chemical changes in organic substrates through the
action of enzymes. In biochemistry, it is narrowly defined as the extraction of
energy from carbohydrates in the absence of oxygen. In food production, it may
more broadly refer to any process in which the activity of microorganisms brings
about a desirable change to a foodstuff or beverage. The science of fermentation
is known as zymology.

Putrefaction is a type of fermentation that produces gases and acids, and is
considered a subset of fermentation.
