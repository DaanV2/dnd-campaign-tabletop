# Multiplication

**♒︎, Aquarius**

The process in alchemy used to duplicate a substance. Or one of its properties.
Mostly used to duplicate a substance such as a metal (Gold, silver), or a stone.
But it can also be used to duplicate a property of a substance, such as its
color, or its smell.

Under specific the right conditions for the material and the alchemist, the
alchemist can create more of the substance, or more of the property. This is
done by using the substance, or the property, as a catalyst. The catalyst is
used to create a reaction that will duplicate the substance, or the property.
