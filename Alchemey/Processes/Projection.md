# Projection

**♓︎, Pisces**

Projection was the ultimate goal of alchemy. Once the philosopher's stone or
powder of projection had been created, the process of projection would be used
to transmute a lesser substance into a higher form; often lead into gold.

Typically, the process is described as casting using a catalyst, to transform
any substance into another substance. The catalyst is usually a substance that
is already in a higher form, such as gold, or a substance that has already been
projected.
