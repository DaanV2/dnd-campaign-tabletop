# Congelation

**♉︎, Taurus**

Other word for crystallization. The processes of changing anything that is not a
solid into a solid. The process of freezing a liquid or solid, or the state of
being frozen. Or creating crystals.

Using magic the alchemist can synthetically create crystals, or crystalline
structure. Its also refines the material, and makes it more pure. It doesn't
have to be a crystal, as metals and other substances can be made into a
crystalline structure. They might just not be as pretty or shiny.
