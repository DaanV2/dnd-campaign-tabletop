# Digestion

**♌︎, Leo**

The process in which gentle heat is applied to a substance over a long period.

This was traditionally performed by sealing a sample of the substance in a
flask, and keeping the flask in fresh horse dung or sometimes in direct
sunlight. Today, practitioners of alchemy use arcane methods to perform this
process.
