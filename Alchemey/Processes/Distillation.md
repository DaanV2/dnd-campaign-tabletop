# Distillation

**♍︎, Virgo**

The process of separating a liquid from a mixture of liquids by boiling and
condensing the mixture. The liquid with the lowest boiling point is the first to
evaporate, and the liquid with the highest boiling point is the last to
evaporate. The liquid with the highest boiling point is the one that is
distilled.
